2. ✅ API keys restricted to Firm plan.
3. ✅ User limit: add-member API in Settings; limit enforced on POST /settings/members.
4. ✅ Full branding (logo) gated to Premium+.

## 2. Feature Unification & Flow

### Flow: Document Upload → Map → Reconcile → Review → Report
| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Upload | ✅ | Cash book + bank statement; Excel, CSV, PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF |
| Map | ✅ | Column mapping, Ghana bank parsers, suggested mapping |
| Reconcile | ✅ | One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, bulk match, bank rules |
| Review | ✅ | Submit for review, approve, reopen |
| Report | ✅ | BRS report, missing cheques, discrepancy, export PDF/Excel |

### UI Consistency
- Role-based visibility (admin, reviewer, preparer, viewer) is applied.
- Settings tabs: route-based (branding, billing, api-keys, bank-rules).
- Project detail: hash-based deep links (#upload, #map, #reconcile, #review, #report).
- Dark mode used across main pages.

### Minor Inconsistencies
- Dashboard and Projects link to `/settings/branding`, etc.; AppLayout Settings links to `/settings` (redirects to branding) – acceptable.
- “Resume” vs “View” for project list: correct by status.

## 3. Calculations

### Projects Count
- **Logic:** `incrementProjects` on project create.
- **Storage:** `UsageLog.projectsCount` per org, per period (YYYY-MM).
- **Limit check:** `canCreateProject` uses `projectsUsed >= projectsLimit` (or unlimited).
- **Status:** ✅ Correct.

### Transactions Count
- **Logic:** `incrementTransactions` in document map flow.
- **Storage:** `UsageLog.transactionsCount` per org, per period.
- **Limit check:** `canAddTransactions` before map; blocks if `transactionsUsed + count > transactionsLimit`.
- **Status:** ✅ Correct.

### BRS Report Calculations
- **Balance per bank statement:** ✅ From bank closing balance.
- **Uncredited lodgments / Unpresented cheques:** ✅ From matched/unmatched transactions.
- **Balance per cash book:** ✅ From cash book closing balance.
- **Adjusted / Reconciled balance:** ✅ Standard BRS logic.
- **Discrepancy report:** ✅ Amount bands (0–1, 1–100, 100–500, 500+), date bands.
- **Missing cheques:** ✅ Ageing buckets.

### Intro Offer
- **Eligibility:** Self-serve tiers; fewer than 2 intro payments applied; `INTRO_OFFER_ENABLED=true`.
- **Discount:** 50% off each of the first 2 billing periods (monthly / quarterly / yearly checkout).
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented in subscription flow (`introOffer.ts`).

## 4. AI / OCR Scraping of Uploaded Content

### Implemented
| Format | Parser | Location | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Excel | xlsx | `parser.ts` | ✅ `parseExcel` |
| CSV | Custom parser | `parser.ts` | ✅ `parseCsv` |
| PDF | Tesseract.js (OCR) | `ocr.ts` | ✅ `parsePdf` (via pdf-to-img) |
| PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP | Tesseract.js | `ocr.ts` | ✅ `parseImage` |

### Flow
1. `detectFileType` chooses excel | csv | pdf | image.
2. `documents.ts` uses `parseExcel`, `parseCsv`, `parsePdf`, or `parseImage` based on type.
3. OCR (Tesseract) used for PDF and images.
4. Output: `{ headers, rows }` passed into column mapping.

### Ghana Bank Parsers
- Ecobank, GCB, Access, Stanbic, Fidelity, UBA, Absa.
- `detectGhanaBankFormat`, `getSuggestedBankMapping`, `extractChqNoFromDescription`.
- Used in document preview for bank statements.

### Known Constraints
1. **PDF OCR:** Limited to `PDF_OCR_MAX_PAGES` (default 50) to control CPU/time.
2. **Table extraction:** `textToTable` splits on tabs or 2+ spaces; complex tables can misalign.
3. **Language:** Tesseract uses `eng`; Ghana-specific text may need tuning.
4. **Structured PDFs:** Native PDF text extraction is not used; all PDFs go through OCR.

### Suggested Improvements
1. Test PDF/image extraction on real Ghana bank statement samples.
2. Consider native PDF text extraction (e.g. pdf-parse) before falling back to OCR for text PDFs.
3. Add logging/telemetry for OCR errors and accuracy.
